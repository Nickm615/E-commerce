# Homework-13-E-commerce

This is an e-commerce back-end application that uses sequelize models to generate a database and express routes to get, post, update and delete those routes. I mostly just followed the instructions and used the activities as a reference. I had to do some troubleshooting to make the relationships work correctly. Thanks for reading/watching.
